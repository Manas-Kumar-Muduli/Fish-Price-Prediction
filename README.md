1.1	Introduction

Global aquaculture production has increased substantially over the last two decades. This growth in the aquaculture industry is mostly associated with technological advancement which brings down the cost of production, higher productivity with fewer inputs increasing demand due to growth in income & population and increasing preferences for seafood. Soon we may see a substantially higher market share of aquatic food by aquaculture because of its well-organized and efficient production technique. The increase in aquaculture productivity alongside low cost of production will lead to a decline in fish price impacting the direction of long-term equilibrium price.
Machine Learning as known is a sub field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that learns from data, discovers the underlying patterns and structures in the data and predicts output for the provided inputs without much human interference. ML algorithms are provided with the boon of handling massive amounts of data. Moreover, these data are not restricted to only numerical or string data, these data can be any form including images, objects, sound tracks and many more. Different ML algorithms offer a variety of functionalities like classifications, regressions, clustering. This project work is focused on making use of 4 ML algorithms that can learn from patient’s data and classify them into either class of individuals with autism and individuals without autism.
The aim of this project is to find a ML algorithm that can best fit the data and predict further cases accordingly and most importantly accurately so that this proposed system can add as a great help to the agriculture field for improved price and production when modified and added with other functionalities for a wide scale application.


1.2	Objectives

	The major aim is to maintain a perfect price condition.
	The price determined by demand and supply is an equilibrium price which is not practical..
	Increase the productivity of fish.
